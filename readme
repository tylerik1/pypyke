This framework uses Python3.  Download the lastest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/.  
Select the advanced setup option and allow the installer to add python to the system path.
Since I used this framework to test AWS and some Selenium the following are the pip packages I used:

webdriverwrapper
requests
boto3
paramiko
pylint
selenium

*** if you get an error about the asset folder not being found, add the \pypyke repo folder to your ENVIORNMENT VARIABLES
path under the name PYTHONPATH: C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\pypyke ***



Adding tests to test suites:
To add tests to a test suite add one or more of the following decorators to the function you wish to test.

@unit
@functional
@regression
@smoke


eg. add create_application to the smoke suite and regression suite.

@smoke
@regression
def create_application():
    ...


Running tests:

Tests can be run as standalone or as part of a test suite.  

    Standalone:
    To run a test as a standalone test, navigate to the location of the test or provide the full path of the file that contains the test.

        running the code to create an application using the REST api.
        eg. python C:\PATH\TO\pypyke\tests\architecture\register_application.py action_rest 


  
    Test suite:
    To run a test suite, navigate to the \pypyke folder or provide the full path of the "test_set_runner.py" file.  The following
    are the available suites to run:

    smoke_test
    unit_test
    functional_test
    regression_test
    all

    example to run all the tests that have been tagged @smoke
    eg. python C:\PATH\TO\pypyke\test_set_runner.py smoke_test

    example to run all tests that have been tagged as @smoke and @regression
    eg. python C:\PATH\TO\pypyke\test_set_runner.py smoke_test regression_test
